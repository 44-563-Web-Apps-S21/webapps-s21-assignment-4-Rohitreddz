<h3>Loves Labours Lost.</h3>

<h4>SCENE I. The king of Navarre's park.</h4>
<p class="stage-direction"> 
Enter FERDINAND king of Navarre, BIRON, LONGAVILLE and DUMAIN</p>
<h5 class="name FERDINAND">FERDINAND</h5> 
<p class="speech">Let fame, that all hunt after in their lives,<br>
Live register'd upon our brazen tombs<br>
And then grace us in the disgrace of death;<br>
When, spite of cormorant devouring Time,<br>
The endeavor of this present breath may buy<br>
That honour which shall bate his scythe's keen edge<br>
And make us heirs of all eternity.<br>
Therefore, brave conquerors,--for so you are,<br>
That war against your own affections<br>
And the huge army of the world's desires,--<br>
Our late edict shall strongly stand in force:<br>
Navarre shall be the wonder of the world;<br>
Our court shall be a little Academe,<br>
Still and contemplative in living art.<br>
You three, Biron, Dumain, and Longaville,<br>
Have sworn for three years' term to live with me<br>
My fellow-scholars, and to keep those statutes<br>
That are recorded in this schedule here:<br>
Your oaths are pass'd; and now subscribe your names,<br>
That his own hand may strike his honour down<br>
That violates the smallest branch herein:<br>
If you are arm'd to do as sworn to do,<br>
Subscribe to your deep oaths, and keep it too.<br></p>
<h5 class="name LONGAVILLE">LONGAVILLE</h5>
<p class="speech">I am resolved; 'tis but a three years' fast:<br>
The mind shall banquet, though the body pine:<br>
Fat paunches have lean pates, and dainty bits<br>
Make rich the ribs, but bankrupt quite the wits.<br></p>
<h5 class="name DUMAIN">DUMAIN</h5>
<p class="speech">My loving lord, Dumain is mortified:<br>
The grosser manner of these world's delights<br>
He throws upon the gross world's baser slaves:<br>
To love, to wealth, to pomp, I pine and die;<br>
With all these living in philosophy.<br></p>
<h5 class="name BIRON">BIRON</h5>
<p class="speech">I can but say their protestation over;<br>
So much, dear liege, I have already sworn,<br>
That is, to live and study here three years.<br>
But there are other strict observances;<br>
As, not to see a woman in that term,<br>
Which I hope well is not enrolled there;<br>
And one day in a week to touch no food<br>
And but one meal on every day beside,<br>
The which I hope is not enrolled there;<br>
And then, to sleep but three hours in the night,<br>
And not be seen to wink of all the day--<br>
When I was wont to think no harm all night<br>
And make a dark night too of half the day--<br>
Which I hope well is not enrolled there:<br>
O, these are barren tasks, too hard to keep,<br>
Not to see ladies, study, fast, not sleep!<br></p>
<h5 class="name FERDINAND">FERDINAND</h5>
<p class="speech">Your oath is pass'd to pass away from these.<br></p>
<h5 class="name BIRON">BIRON</h5>
<p class="speech">Let me say no, my liege, an if you please:<br>
I only swore to study with your grace<br>
And stay here in your court for three years' space.<br></p>
<h5 class="name LONGAVILLE">LONGAVILLE</h5>
<p class="speech">You swore to that, Biron, and to the rest.<br></p>
<h5 class="name BIRON">BIRON</h5>
<p class="speech">By yea and nay, sir, then I swore in jest.<br>
What is the end of study? let me know.<br></p>
<h5 class="name FERDINAND">FERDINAND</h5>
<p class="speech">Why, that to know, which else we should not know.<br>
