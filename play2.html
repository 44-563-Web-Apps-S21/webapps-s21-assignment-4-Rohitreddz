    To know the thing I am forbid to know:<br>
    As thus,--to study where I well may dine,<br>
    When I to feast expressly am forbid;<br>
    Or study where to meet some mistress fine,<br>
    When mistresses from common sense are hid;<br>
    Or, having sworn too hard a keeping oath,<br>
    Study to break it and not break my troth.<br>
    If study's gain be thus and this be so,<br>
    Study knows that which yet it doth not know:<br>
    Swear me to this, and I will ne'er say no.</p>
